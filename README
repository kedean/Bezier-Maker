Python version of my Bezier demo. There will be GUI controls at a later date, but currently the controls include:  
  
left mouse click - add a control point 
right mouse click - remove the closest point within n pixels, hardcoded to 5 currently
a - animate the calculations over 1 second.  
p - pause or resume animation  
s - perform an animation step, can be done without starting animation  
shift+s - reverse an animation step  
c - clear the control points 
r - remove the last added point  
d - toggle debug mode

Requirements  
----------  
  
Runs and tested on Python 2.7, requires an installation of Pyglet.  
It must be run in 32-bit python due to pyglet use. On Mac OSX this requires  

    arch -i386 python main.py

where 'python' is the absolute path to your python interpreter. Just 'python' will work if using the OSX included version.

Future
----------

- turn it into a module, maybe multiple options for drawing API
- zooming in/out (scaling)
- detail slider
- possible 3d mode with rotation
