Python version of my Bezier demo. There will be GUI controls at a later date, but currently the controls include:

left mouse click - add a control point
a - animate the calculations over 1 second.
p - pause or resume animation
s - perform an animation step, can be done without starting animation
shift+s - reverse an animation step
c - clear the control points
